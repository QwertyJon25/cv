        <p>Jon Courtier is a fine chap and a misunderstood force of nature. He has spent all of his life fighting an uphill battle, but he's a lucky guy, so I wouldn't worry too much. Known far and wide for spinning a <strong>mean</strong> yarn and
          sketching some dandy
          items. On the rare occasion, it has even been said, that he can grant <strong>wishes</strong> with
          <em>whistles</em>. <em><strong>Oh well</strong></em>. What are you gonna do, baby?
